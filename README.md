To run website locally, in SRC dir:
`python3 run.py`

There are several packages that will need to be downloaded. The list is available in this repo, but you can also just as easily run the project, **python or python3 run.py** and download the dependencies as it requests.

Used Azure DevOps for backlogs, sprints, and repos. Because everything was completed on Azure DevOps, the class members have not been credited in this repo.

Thanks to the help of Jake Ammons and Chase Autry
